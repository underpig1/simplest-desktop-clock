What it does:

## Install
To install the program, simply download the project, navigate to the folder, and run `install.bat`.

To remove the clock just navigate to the folder and run `uninstall.bat`. Don't forget to restard your computer after uninstalling it for the changes to take place.

## Customizing your clock
After installing you can customize your clock by running `customize.bat` at any time, or do it manually by changing values in `custom.py`.
#### Themes
Find premade themes for your clock in the `themes` folder. Run any of these to set the clock's theme. You can find the default theme at `themes/defaults.bat`.

Make a theme by running `theme.bat`; you will be able to find custom themes in the `themes` folder.

Have fun!
