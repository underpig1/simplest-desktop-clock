The simplest possible customizable desktop clock on any operating system ðŸ˜Ž made with python

What it does:
- It's a desktop clock
- It changes colors with your wallpaper
- That's about it

## Install
To install the program, simply download the project, navigate to the folder, and install the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.text
```
Then customize your clock in `custom.py`. See below for some things you can do to customize it.

Then, copy the files to your start folder so it appears every time your computer starts up. The start folder is at `\Users\[USER]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\`

Don't forget to change \[USER\] to your current user!

To remove the clock after installing it, just delete the files from the start folder and restart your computer.

Simple, right?
